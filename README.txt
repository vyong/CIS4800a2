**************
Complications
**************
There are two complications with the program. The first complication is that when the program initially loads up, if the height map isn't in origin [0,0,0], the camera won't show the height map. Only when you move the camera around with the left and right click capabilities, it will then show the height map.

The second complication is the camera controls. I wasn't able to get the camera to rotate fully around the object, but holding the right button down allows you to view three sides of the object.

************
Compilation
************
To compile, make sure you are in the correct directory with all the folders and the makefile on the terminal. once confirmed, type 'make' in the terminal. This will compile the code and create three files in the same folder

***********************
Running the program(s)
***********************
to run the program, after compiling (see Compilation), type './a <filename>', and the program will execute
